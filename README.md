Rules for Naming Python Variables
Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). For example:
snake_case
MACRO_CASE
camelCase
CapsWords



Python is case-sensitive. So num and Num are different variables.
